a)Cache Simulator

The Cache Simulator is a Java program that simulates a cache memory system. It reads a trace file containing memory addresses and performs cache operations such as cache hits and misses. The simulator allows you to specify the cache size, associativity, and block size to configure the cache system.

b)Features

- Simulates cache memory operations based on a trace file
- Calculates cache hits and misses
- Provides set-wise hit and miss statistics
- Supports customizable cache size, associativity, and block size


c)Usage

1. Compile the Java source code: javac CacheSimulator.java
2. Run the program with the following command: java CacheSimulator <Cache Size> <Associativity> <Trace File>

Replace `<Cache Size>` with the desired cache size in kilobytes (KB).
Replace `<Associativity>` with the desired associativity value.
Replace `<Trace File>` with the path to the trace file containing memory addresses.

3. The program will simulate the cache operations and display the following results:

Total Misses: X
Total Hits: Y
Total Inputs: Z

Set-wise Misses:
Set 0: A
Set 1: B
...

Set-wise Hits:
Set 0: C
Set 1: D
...

- `Total Misses`: Total number of cache misses during the simulation.
- `Total Hits`: Total number of cache hits during the simulation.
- `Total Inputs`: Total number of memory addresses read from the trace file.
- `Set-wise Misses`: Number of cache misses for each set in the cache.
- `Set-wise Hits`: Number of cache hits for each set in the cache.

d)Trace File Format

The trace file should contain memory addresses in hexadecimal format, separated by whitespace. Each line of the file represents a sequence of memory addresses accessed in a particular order.
